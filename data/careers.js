            <h1>Full stack Developer</h1>
            <p>
              Build a transparent and open source DeFi portfolio dashboard. Salary ~$50k per year and up based on experience.
            </p>
            <p>
            Portfolio trackers should be open and transparent with data policy that respects users.
            We run this ecosystem so that everyone can have a fair, transparent and open-source access to crypto and web3.
            </p>

            <h3>TLDR;</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Anon friendly</li>
              <li>Max autonomy and control over your work</li>
              <li>High impact</li>
              <li>No meetings, all comms are async</li>
              <li>Small team, horizontal leadership</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Culture</h3>
            <p>
              What we value the most is speed of execution, and we actively try to remove anything extraneous or not needed.
            </p>
            <p>
              This creates an environment where we instantly extend a lot of trust to everyone (we just trust that they are actively working, we won't micro-manage to make sure you do X hours on Y days), and the following people thrive:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>You want to get involved in a new project with high growth prospects and plenty of responsibilities</li>
              <li>You enjoy having full control over your work and the tools you use.</li>
              <li>You enjoy making a large impact</li>
              <li>You have strong initiative, if you identify something that could be improved you just go and improve it</li>
              <li>You want to stop wasting time on things like meetings and stuff that doesn't matter and instead prefer having full and un-interrupted control of your time</li>
              <li>You believe in what LlamaFolio is building</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              However it doesn't work for the following people:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>We don't micro-manage so team members are expected to do their work as requested and meet their deadlines. They are trusted to deliver and self-manage.</li>
              <li>You have low intrinsic motivation: Most people at LlamaFolio work independently, so if you don't have a strong intrinsic motivation it's very likely you'll get demotivated and stop working.</li>
            </ul>
