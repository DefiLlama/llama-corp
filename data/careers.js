        Portfolio trackers should be open and transparent with data policy that respects users.

        <ul>
          <li>Anon friendly</li>
          <li>Max autonomy and control over your work</li>
          <li>High impact</li>
          <li>No meetings, all comms are async</li>
          <li>Small team, horizontal leadership</li>

        <h3>Culture</h3>

        <p>
          LlamaTracker is built by shippers. What we value the most is speed of execution, and we actively try to remove anything extraneous or not needed.
        </p>

        <p>
          This creates an environment where we instantly extend a lot of trust to everyone (we just trust that they are actively working, we won't micro-manage to make sure you do X hours on Y days), and the following people thrive:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>You want to get involved in a new project with high growth prospects and plenty of responsibilities</li>
          <li>You enjoy having full control over your work and the tools you use.</li>
          <li>You enjoy making a large impact</li>
          <li>You have strong initiative, if you identify something that could be improved you just go and improve it</li>
          <li>You want to stop wasting time on things like meetings and stuff that doesn't matter and instead prefer having full and un-interrupted control of your time</li>
          <li>You believe in what LlamaTracker is building</li>
          <li>Ready to take on any role that's needed (we don't have classic separations like dev, product owner... everyone does everything. We personally find this very enjoyable, there's nothing like talking to users directly and seeing how they use what you built, then implementing features they request in a few hours).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          However it doesn't work for the following people:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>We don't micro-manage so team members are expected to do their work as requested and meet their deadlines. They are trusted to deliver and self-manage.</li>
          <li>You have low intrinsic motivation: Most people at LlamaTracker work independently, so if you don't have a strong intrinsic motivation it's very likely you'll get demotivated and stop working.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h3>Employee benefits</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Performance based bonuses</li>
          <li>Equity packages</li>
          <li>Fully remote positions</li>
        </ul>
